In HTTP Stream, the initial request is left open even after the server has responded to the client\u2019s request with data. Leaving the request channel open indefinitely makes it possible for the server to continually send responses to the client whenever new data is available or there is an update or change.

WebSockets provides the relevant and most efficient means to achieve real-time communication. In this article, we explored the concept of WebSockets, its benefits, why it is superior to other traditional HTTP methods, and why developers should adopt WebSockets. Finally, we illustrated how to integrate WebSockets into React and Node.js applications."))}g.isMDXComponent=!0}}]);
